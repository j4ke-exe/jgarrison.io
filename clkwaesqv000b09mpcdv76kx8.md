This walkthrough covers the [Olympus](https://tryhackme.com/room/olympusroom) CTF found on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/). The goal of this challenge is to exploit an SQLi vulnerability in a CMS, use sqlmap to acquire user credentials by extracting a database, identify a subdomain hosting a chat application, upload a reverse shell to establish a foothold on the system and take advantage of a poorly managed SUID binary to escalate privileges.

### Step 1: What's Out There?

```bash
nmap -sS -sV -sC -p 22,80 olympus.thm --min-rate=1000
```

### Step 2: FFUF

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt:FUZZ -u http://olympus.thm/FUZZ -fc 403
```

We discovered a directory named `~webmaster`, which is where the CMS is located.

### Step 3: SQLi

Testing the Victor CMS search field feature reveals an SQLi:

```sql
'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='' and password='' OR 1=1;
```

Let's capture this with `Burp Suite` and plug it into `sqlmap` to automate our injection attack.

Copy this over to a text editor and run it through `sqlmap`.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691135274129/7dcdf2db-1f04-4e90-8bd4-79b752237fc1.webp align="center")

We discovered a flag in olympus, let's dump it.

Let's obtain our first flag.

```bash
sqlmap -r req.txt --batch --dump -T flag -D olympus
```

Now let's see what that user's table can offer us.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691135315500/d0fe3ef4-d4f8-4aa6-83c2-95d9d74ab2cc.jpeg align="center")

Juicy credentials, we can crack the password hash to *prometheus* and use it to log in to the chat application.

### Step 4: Enumerate Subdomain

We discovered three users: *root*, *zeus*, and *prometheus*. Additionally, we discovered a subdomain called `chat` that can be added to our `/etc/hosts` list.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691135339781/9f65783f-2537-4336-bcdb-8d556637c10e.webp align="center")

Let's enumerate the newly discovered subdomain.

I'm sure the uploads directory will play an important role later, in the meantime let's see if we can log in with these credentials.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691135363114/4f647e65-7e79-4401-a1bc-67e6e1329080.webp align="center")

And we're in. There looks to be an upload feature, let's see if we can upload a reverse shell.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691135371739/99d49d50-44ff-49ae-aa77-8634ee42d4a3.webp align="center")

It looks to have been uploaded somewhere, but not sure where. Let's go back to `sqlmap` and dump the chats table to see if the file name was changed upon uploading.

```bash
sqlmap -r req.txt --batch --dump -T chats -D olympus
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691135388161/79fa1af1-215a-4c87-9ce9-87b7daa747ae.webp align="center")

Looks like it did. Let's copy this and see if we can visit and go to it using the `/uploads/` directory we found earlier.

Going to the path drops us into a shell. Searching for SUID binaries reveals `cputils`.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691135397019/2a652788-32b6-4cf5-93f2-6daa330e48df.webp align="center")

We can copy over *zeus* `id_rsa key` and then ssh in with it.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691135403791/bb79bcd0-4905-4d25-a28a-faca1fe4aacb.webp align="center")

Crack it using `ssh2john` and `john-the-ripper`.

### Step 5: Privesc and Root

After looking around the file system for a while we discovered this:

Inside the PHP file seems to be a backdoor.

Running `uname -a; w; /lib/defended/libc.so.99` drops us into a root shell.

This box was very difficult for me. I don't consider myself to be that knowledgeable on SQLi attacks, so I had to resort to a lot of googling to help me through. I will definitely give this box several more runs as I need to sharpen my command injection skills. As always, Happy Hacking!
