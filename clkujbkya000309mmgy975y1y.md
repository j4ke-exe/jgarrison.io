### Mindset

---

> "Those who work the hardest usually complain the least." -Ryan Cohen

My journey in cybersecurity up to this point has been incredibly rewarding. Initially, I was unsure of where to even begin. This career path resembles a hydra with countless heads; just when you think you've grasped one concept, you're introduced to new ones that are twice as challenging as the previous ones you've learned. However, my favorite quote keeps me grounded: "Those who work the hardest usually complain the least." Ryan Cohen, the CEO of GameStop and an activist investor, is my most significant role model. He is ambitious, intelligent, and never believes in giving up. This is the mindset one must adopt when pursuing a career in cybersecurity.

### Capture the Flag (CTF)

---

As a beginner with no background in Information Security or Information Technology, I recommend joining platforms like TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and PicoCTF. These environments provide a wealth of educational content that will help you build on fundamental concepts and progress to more intermediate and advanced topics. When I first entered this industry, I started with TryHackMe and soon pursued the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification from EC-Council after developing a passion for it. CTF platforms are both challenging and rewarding, designed to encourage critical thinking and outside-the-box problem-solving in order to capture flags and *pwn* boxes.

### Where I Currently Stand

---

I am currently enrolled in a university, pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a focus on Cybersecurity Engineering. As of writing this blog, I still haven't completed my homework assignment due tomorrow night, even though I know I will be struggling. I find it more exciting to write, learn, and practice by completing CTF challenges. In addition to this, I am also enrolled in the Practical Junior Penetration Tester (PJPT) certification path by TCM Security. I just wish someone could throw a book at me on offensive security, and I would instantly know everything! However, the reality is that I struggle to stay on track, and, combined with my ADHD, learning and completing tasks one at a time becomes extremely difficult. But this is where I am, trying to learn as much as I can, as quickly as I can, because I am eager to improve.

I would be foolish not to expect failure at some point. However, it would be even more foolish to believe that I wouldn't pick myself up and continue learning.
